\chapter{Future Work}

This dissertation introduced three novel analyses that helps the designer understand the circuits better and optimize their performance. In addition to optimization, it
helps us make changes and propose new circuits. For example, the PFD phase noise analysis suggests to use various digital gates in the PFD circuit rather than all-NAND or
all-NOR topologies. Another possible research path is to find the relation between the phase noise of LC oscillator and that of a single common-source amplifier with an
RLC tank as the load. That might give us more insight and guidelines on the LC oscillator design. Finally, the analysis of current-driven mixers allows us to optimize the
mixers for minimum noise figure or may suggest circuit modifications to create new topologies that exhibit lower noise or higher conversion gain or better harmonic
rejection.
