The principle of the method is three-fold: (1) encoding of the lateral and axial coordinates of the target into the different frequencies and corresponding amplitudes of a spatially dispersed broadband pulse which spectrally interferes with a reference pulse, (2) amplified dispersive Fourier transformation in which the spectrum is mapped into a temporal waveform, time-stretched so that it can be digitized in real time, and simultaneously amplified in the optical domain, and (3) Hilbert transformation on the detected pulse in the digital domain to extract the axial information of the target.}}{4}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Concept of HDLS. HDLS operation relies on two high-speed mapping processes. First, the spectrum of each broadband optical pulse generated by a mode-locked laser is mapped to time. This wavelength-to-time mapping is performed by a temporal dispersive element such as a dispersive optical fiber or prism pair. Next, wavelength-to-space transformation is used to direct each wavelength component of the optical pulse to a unique point on the target. Overall, a one-to-one mapping between time and space is formed. Therefore, each point in HDLS’ field of view is sampled with an individual wavelength component of the optical pulse at a specific time. The repetition rate of the mode-locked laser determines the sampling rate of the HDLS.}}{12}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces HDLS experimental setup. In a 2D demonstration of laser scanning with the HDLS, optical pulses generated by a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser with a center wavelength of 814 nm and a repetition rate of 90.8 MHz are dispersed in time using two pairs of prisms and a dispersive fiber. Pulses are deflected in the vertical direction using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) at 105.4 kHz. Subsequently, the spectrum of each pulse is mapped onto a horizontal line using a pair of diffraction gratings. A combination of the vertical deflection and horizontal mapping leads to a 2D raster scan on the target. The pulse reflection off the surface of the target is converted via an optical circulator to an electrical signal using a single-pixel high-speed photodetector. This is possible due to the prior wavelength-to-time mapping, so that each wavelength component reaches the photodetector at a unique time, and the information of different points of the target are not overlapped. A 50 GS/s digitizer acquires the electrical signal from the photodetector, which corresponds to the spectrum of the optical pulses. After correction for the background envelope, the spectrum of each pulse reveals one horizontal line scan image of the target. Stacking up many of these line scans in accordance with the AOD scan frequency leads to a 2D raster scan of the target.}}{15}

(a) Optical pulses reflected off the target corresponding to horizontal line scans at different deflection angles of the AOD are measured by a high-speed photodetector. The period of the horizontal scans is about 11 ns, which corresponds to the mode-locked laser’s pulse repetition rate (90.8 MHz). (b) Good agreement between the amplitude of the photodetector signal measured with the digitizer (shown in blue) and the power spectrum measured with a conventional optical spectrum analyzer indicates the demonstration of the wavelength-to-time mapping using the prism pairs and dispersive fiber in the 800 nm band.}}{16}

(b) Image of the same sample captured by the HDLS. The word “UCLA” is clearly shown. Combining the HDLS with an interferometer, we performed 3D surface profilometry or 2D surface vibrometry (Figure 2.5\hbox {}). Here we used a Michelson interferometer to encode phase delays of different points on the target into wavelength components of the illumination pulses. The interferograms are then captured in time, and analyzed offline by Hilbert transformation to extract the phase variations, which correspond to the axial positions. Our experimental setup enables an axial resolution of 0.4 nm at a scan rate of 105.4 kHz. As an illustrative demonstration, we captured vibrations of a reflective diaphragm oscillating at 1 kHz (Figure 2.6\hbox {}).}}{17}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.5}{\ignorespaces 3D surface profilometry or 2D surface vibrometry with the HDLS. 2D raster scans by the HDLS are used in conjunction with a Michelson interferometer to perform 2D surface vibrometry. A beamsplitter splits scan pulses into two arms. Optical pulses in one arm hit the target, and the light in the other arm (reference arm) is reflected intactly by a mirror. Reflected pulses from both arms are combined at the beamsplitter and form an interference pattern. If the reflectivity of the vibrating target is not changing rapidly, Hilbert transformation can be used to extract the relative optical phase of each wavelength component. Therefore, variations of the optical path length at each wavelength component are measured and used to form 3D surface profiles of the vibrating sample at a scan rate of 105.4 kHz with 0.4 nanometer axial resolution.}}{18}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.7}{\ignorespaces Comparison of conventional and HDLS flow cytometers. (a) In regular flow cytometry, a single interrogation beam covers the desired field of view in the channel. Therefore, it does not efficiently differentiate multiple cells such as doublets. In HDLS flow-cytometer, diffraction limited wavelength components of the interrogation beam cover the required field of view, and extract high-resolution spatial information of the sample. HDLS data can be used to identify abnormalities e.g. multiple cells and result in a lower statistical error. (b) In our demonstration of HDLS flow cytometer, an inertial focusing microfluidic channel with a dielectric mirror substrate is used to order randomly distributed cells into a single stream. The microfluidic device was fabricated using standard replica molding methods in thermoset polyester (TPE) to ensure stability. HDLS scan pulses are focused on the stream. Forward-scattered light from the cells is reflected by substrate mirror and collected by an objective lens. (c) Identical samples of white blood cells and MCF7 breast cancer cells are measured separately with conventional and HDLS flow cytometers. There is a considerable overlap in forward scattering range of these cell types for a conventional flow cytometer. However, this overlap decreases significantly for HDLS flow cytometer measurements because white blood cell multiples are not identified as MCF7 cancer cells. (d) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves based on identification of white blood cells and MCF7 breast cancer cells show that without sacrificing throughput, HDLS flow cytometer achieves higher specificity and sensitivity than a conventional flow cytometer.}}{20}
